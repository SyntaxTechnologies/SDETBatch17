Object oriented programming:
    Its just a way(Set of rules) of writing code
    It basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easier
    to change and manage. There are other ways like functional programming
    and procedural programming.
Why we should use OOP?
    1) It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
    2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
    3) Changing code becomes easier.
    4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier.
Main concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
    1) Classes and Objects.(Base not considered main pillar)
    2) Inheritance.
    3) Polymorphism
    4) Abstraction
    5) Encapsulation.
Classes and Objects:
    A Class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we
    start building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes
    which help us figure out how something looks like and they
    have behaviours/functions which help us understand how something works.
