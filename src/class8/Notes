Arrays:
    Arrays are datastructures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Indexes always start from
    zero.
Why should we use arrays?
    Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data
    easily with the help of loops. Whenever we have more than 3 similar items that
    we can to store and process together we should always go with arrays.
Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating the arrays
    Method1:
    DataType[] nameOfTheArray={element1,element2,element3};
    Method2:
    DataType[] nameOfTheArray= new DataType[Size];

Enhanced For Loop:
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through datastructures which have multiple
    items stored inside them.
Why should we use Enhanced For Loop:
    Its simple and easy to understand.
Syntax:
     for(DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure){

     }

Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
    1) Enhanced for loop can't be used for updating the elements.
    2) Access the elements in the reverse order etc.
