Maps:
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs.
    There are many different types of maps in java but we will be discussing
    1)HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3)TreeMap 4)HashTable. Maps are not part of
    the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and
    HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable are the clsses that implement
    this interface.
Why We should learn about Maps?
    All the other datastructures that we have learnt can only store
    one value at a time and they are indexed based.
    Maps allow us to store key value pairs which makes the a better choice
    because we know what we are storing.
Syntax of Maps:
    NameOfTheClass<DataTypeOfKey,DataTypeOfValue> variableName=new NameOfTheClass<>();
    HashMap<String,Double> names= new HashMap<>();
