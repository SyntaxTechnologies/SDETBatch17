Logical Operators:
     Logical operators help combine multiple conditions on the same line in if
     statements. There are three types of logical operators NOT(!) OR(||)
     AND(&&).
NOT(!):
    true=>false
    false=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
    1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
    2) Code readability will in increase.
OR(||):
    Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way
    that as soon as one condition gets true the whole condition will be
    evaluated to true.
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
true||true||true=>true
AND(&&)
    Logical and Operator will help us combine the conditions in such a way
    that it will only give us true if all the conditions are true.
true && false && true=>false
true && true && true=>true
true && true && false=>false
