Inheritance:
     Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and
     methods from another class except private members and constructors.
     We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about Inheritance:
    1) Faster development
    2) Saves memory

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    }

    class Child extends Parent{

    }

Rules:
    1) Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single
    2) Hierarchical
    3) MultiLevel
    4) Hybrid
    5) Multiple(It is not supported by java)
1)Single Inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child(Not very common).
2)Hierarchical:
    One parent multiple child.

3)MultiLevel:
    Multilevel inheritance happens when a class C inherits from B and B inherits from A.
4) Hybrid:
    Hybrid is a mixture of Hierarchical and MultiLevel.
5)Multiple:
        Multiple parent classes and one child class.
What is Diamond problem in OOP?
     The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and a further class D
     inherits from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
     and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
