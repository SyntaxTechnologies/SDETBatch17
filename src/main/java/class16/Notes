Constructors:
    Constructors hlp us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way.
    We can also put any piece of code that we want to execute when the object of a class is created.

Why we should use Constructors?

They help us write more secure classes
Cleaner code
More control over the values we can assign to the instance fields

Syntax:

No return type not even void
Same name as class
Usually public access modifier
Parameters
Body of the constructor

Rules:




Create Cat class define 6 fields create multiple constructors to give
flexibility to the end user. PrintInfo method as well to print all the details of
a cat.
