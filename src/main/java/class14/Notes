Access modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control
    the access of instance and static variables they can also be used
    to control the access of methods and classes. There are four access levels
    and there are three keywords in java to apply these access levels.
    private protected default public
Best Practices:
    Instance variables/fields/properties/attributes are
    private 99% of the time.
    99% of the times constructors are public
    90% of the times methods are public 8% private and rest
    of the time they are default or protected.
