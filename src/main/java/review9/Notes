SuperKeyword:
    Super keyword refers to parent class. We can use super-keyword to access
    variables, methods and constructors from the parent class.
Why we should use super keyword?
    1) To specifically call something from the parent class. like
    a variable or method.
    2) We can use super() to call the constructor from the parent.
MethodOverloading:
    1) When we have same method with different parameters its called method
    overloading. Parameters can be different in 3 ways.
    1) We can change the count of the parameters. We can overload methods as well
    as constructors.
    2) we can also change the datatype of parameters if number of parameters are
    same.
    3) we can change the sequence if datatype and number of parameters are same.
Why?
    1) Cleaner code: we don't have to come up with different method names.
    2) Reuse: same name can be reused many times.
interview Questions?
    1) Can we overload a private method?
    Yes
    2) Can we overload a static method?
    Yes
    3) Can we overload the main method?
    Yes
    4) Can we overload a method by changing its return type?
    No
    5) Can we overload a protected method?
    Yes
==========================================
MethodOverriding:
    When same method is present in parent as well as child class. its
    called method overriding. When we override a method Java prefers
    the method from the child class.
Why?
