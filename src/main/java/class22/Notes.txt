Interface:
    Interfaces are like contracts. In which we define abstract methods
    which the classes have to implement. They can also have public static
    final variables.
Why should we learn about interfaces?
    1)Specially designed for abstraction.
    2) Light weight as compared to abstract classes.
    3) we can achieve multiple inheritance in interfaces.
    4) There is no Diamond problem when having multiple inheritance.
    5) Help us build things in a modular way can be used with classes
    even if they are not closely related.
Rules:
    1) Interfaces don't have instance methods but can have static methods.
    2) No instance fields are allowed all fields inside an interface are
    public static final.
    3) No constructors are allowed.
    4) Can't create Objects as there are no constructs.
    5) Can't have final keyword with interface or method as they are by default
    abstract.
    6) We can have multiple inheritance as there is no Diamond problem.
    7) We can implements keyword when we have to implement an interface.
