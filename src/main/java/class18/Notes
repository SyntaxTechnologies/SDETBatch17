Super Keyword:
        Super keyword is used to access things from the parent class.
        We can access instance variables, Methods and Constructors.
Why should we learn about Super:
    1)Without Super() we can't call the constructor from the parent class and we might
    have to repeat that constructor in all of the class and if someone declare the
    fileds private we will not be able to even access the fields in child classes.
    2) We can use super to call the fileds from the parent class if we have same
    name fields in the child class.
Rules:
    1)when we use super() we must call at least one constructor from the parent class.
    because java needs at least one constructor from parent as it always first
    creates the object of the parent class when we create the object of the child
    class.
    2) When we have same name field as local instance and in the parent class as well.
    Java prefers the local first then the instance of the same class then the instance
    of the parent class. However if we directly want to access the field from the
    parent we can use super keyword.
