Collections Framework:
    Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces in java that
    we use to store large amounts of data easily. There are many
    classes containing many useful methods to manipulate the data.
    These Data Structures are dynamic.
Why we should be learning CF?
    1)Not fixed in size like arrays.
    2) They have ready made methods which we can just use.
Any DownSides?
    Yes
    1)They are slower than arrays
    2) As they only work with non-primitives they occupy more memory.
Wrapper Classes:
    Objects that allow us to work with primitive data types in collections.
    For every primitive datatype java developers created a Class os that we can
    store the primitive data in collections framework. They also have a way of
    converting a primitive to an equivalent wrapper its called boxing and when
    we do the reverse its called unboxing.
Some of the main classes in collections framework:
Lists
1)They maintain the insertion order.
2)They can store duplicate data as well.
1)ArrayList implements List
2)LinkedList implements List
=================================================
remove() -> only removes one element
removeIf() removes all of the elements which meets the condition.
removeAll removes a complete list of the elements
set() -> replaces only one element
replaceAll -> all the elements which meets a specific condition will be replaced
Sets:
    They don't allow duplicate data.
HashSet
    UpSide: Fastest
    DownSide: Insertion order is not maintained.

LinkedHashSet
Upside: maintains the insertion order
DownSide: Its a little slow as compared to the HashSet

TreeSet:
    Upside: Keeps the data sorted
    Insertion speed is super slow.
    Searching is fastest.
