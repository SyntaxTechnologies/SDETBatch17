Nested Loops:
    A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Nested loops are used
    to solve complex problems in which we have nested data or we need to perform
    nested iterations. We can nest a for loop inside a while loop or a
    for loop inside another for loop.
Why Nested Loops:
    A tester we will be needing them to read excel data.
    we will be needing them to go through multiple pages and from
    each page we might want to go through multiple items.
Syntax:
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
     for(int j=0;j<10;j++){

        }
    }
Arrays:
    Arrays help us store multiple objects of the same type in just one
    variable. They are index based datastructures. Every item that we store
    inside an array is assigned a number that number is called index. Whenever
    we want to get any value from the array we provide that index.
Why we should use arrays:
    We can use multiple variables as well to store multiple items but when the
    data is large it almost impossible to handle the variables. imagine we have
    store the names of all the persons living in a city.
Syntax:
   There are two ways of creating an array.
   1) DataType [] nameOfArray={element1,element2,element3}
   int [] ages={25,32,29,45}
   2) DataType [] nameOfArray= new DataType[Size]
   int [] ages=new int[5]
   ages[0]=25;
   ages[1]=32;
   ages[1]=50;
   ages[1]=40;
   ages[1]=18;
