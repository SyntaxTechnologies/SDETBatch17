PolyMorphism:
    Its the ability of an object to behave differently. We
    can achieve polymorphism in two ways one is methodOverloading and other is
    methodOverriding(Very Common).

Why Should we learn about PolyMorphism?
    1) It allows us to write dynamic programs. Which can saves us a lot of
    code repetition.


Example
    Webdriver webdriver=new ChromeDriver();
    ChromeDriver chromeDriver=new ChromeDriver();
Interview Questions:
    Do we need MethodOverriding for polymorphism?
    Yes but we can also do this using methodOverloading.
Abstraction:
    Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details
    and showing only the functionality. We can achieve abstraction using abstract classes
    and interfaces.

Why:
    When we use Abstraction it simplifies our code. Those classes which don't
    need to provide the implementation to the methods can leave it.
keywords:
    abstract.
1)Can we have private methods as abstract methods?
    Private means no participation in inheritance which
    means no overriding which will make abstract method useless.
2) Can we have a method as final and abstract at the same time?
    Final means something is complete and does not require any modification
    and abstract means something is incomplete and requires modification.
    These are opposite to each other and not allowed.
Interfaces:
    Interfaces are collection of public static final variables and methods which are
    by default public and abstract. After Java 8 we can have default, static and
    private methods as well.
Why use interfaces?
    1) There is no Diamond problem in interfaces which allow us to have multiple
    inheritance.
    2) They are light weight simple contracts and can be used even the classes are
    not related to each other.

        Private means no participation in inheritance which

        Final means something is complete and does not require any modification
        and abstract means something is incomplete and requires modification.
