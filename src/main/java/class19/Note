Method Overloading:
    Method overloading happens when multiple methods with same name but with
    different parameters.
    1) Different number of parameters for example min(2,3) min(4,5,6)
    2) Different datatype of methods  print("Java") ,print(12);
    3) Different sequence/order of parameters print("Java",12), print(12,"Java")
Why should we learn about method overloading:
    1)Cleaner code
    2) We don't need to come up with different method names

Syntax:
    class Calculator{

    int add(int a,int b){
    return a+b;
    }

    int add(int a,int b,int c){
        return a+b+c;
        }

     double add(double a,double b){
        return a+b;
        }

        long add(long a,long b){
                return a+b;
                }

    }
MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverriding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as
    in child class.

Note:
    Signature of a method:
        method name plus its parameters are called signature of a method.
    Header of a method:
        Header of a method includes signature plus return type plus access modifier.

Topics to revise for Selenium.

    1)Classes and Objects
    2)Methods
    3)String methods
    4)loops
    5)if-else
Approach:
    1)Read slides if something is not clear watch short videos from youtube
    for that specific topic
    2) Solve your HW/Repls again.
