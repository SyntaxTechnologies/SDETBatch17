What is Object oriented programming(OOP)
    Its simply a way of writing code. some rules that we follow. there are other ways
    as well like functional programming,procedural programming. There are four main
    pillars of OOP 1)inheritance 2) Polymorphism 3) Abstraction 4) Encapsulation.
Why should we learn OOP:
    1) Code re-usability.
    2) Its easier to write large amounts of code.
    3) sharing code with others become easier.
    4) Security of the code is increased.
    5) Changing code becomes easier.
Object:
    An Object is something that we can physically touch. Everything around us like
    chairs, tables, computer etc. They are all objects. We can easily represent
    these objects inside our computers by telling a computer how an object
    looks like and how it behaves.

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the
    information inside computers is processed in this form. String is most widely
    used class in all java.
Creating objects from String class.
      1)length() 2) isEmpty()
