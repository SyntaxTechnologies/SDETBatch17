MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same methods in parent and child class. We call it
    method Overriding.
Why should we learn about Overriding:
    Method Overriding gives us a lot flexibility for example if we don't like
    a method from the parent class we can override it/change.

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    void eat(){
    sout "Fish"
    }
    }
   class Child extends Parent{

   void eat(){
   sout "Chicken"
   }
   }
