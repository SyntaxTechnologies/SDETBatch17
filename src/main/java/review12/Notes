Set:
    Sets are special set of classes which do not allow duplicate elements.
    Set the is the main interface and there are three main classes which implement this
    interface. 1)HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet.
HashSet:
    UpSide: Its fastest of all.
    DownSide: It does not remember the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Maintains the insertion order.
    DownSide: Its a little slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Upside: Keeps the data in sorted form.
    DownSide: Insertion is very very slow.
Maps:
    Map is an interface that allows us to store key value pairs.
