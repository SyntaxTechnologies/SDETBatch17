Constructors:
    Constructor help us build objects from classes easily. They help us give initial values to
    the instance fields. The name of the constructor must be same as the class name.
    Constructors don't have any return types. Most of the times constructors are public.
    Other than initializing the values we can have whatever type of code inside the constructor that
    we like for example calling methods writing if-else etc.

Class ClassName{
String name;

public ClassName(){

}

public ClassName(String myName){
name=myName;
}

}
