Arrays:
    Arrays are datastructures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Indexes always start from
    zero.
Why should we use arrays?
    Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data
    easily with the help of loops. Whenever we have more than 3 similar items that
    we can to store and process together we should always go with arrays.
Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating the arrays
    Method1:
    DataType[] nameOfTheArray={element1,element2,element3};
    Method2:
    DataType[] nameOfTheArray= new DataType[Size];

Enhanced For Loop:
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through datastructures which have multiple
    items stored inside them.
Why should we use Enhanced For Loop:
    Its simple and easy to understand.
Syntax:
     for(DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure){

     }

Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
    1) Enhanced for loop can't be used for updating the elements.
    2) Access the elements in the reverse order etc.
break:
    break keyword is used in switch cases statements and with the loops
    to terminate the loops prematurely.
Why we should use break keyword:
     using break keyword can help save a lot of processing time and our code can
     execute faster.
continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop once we hit the skip keyword
    java ignores the rest of the code in the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
