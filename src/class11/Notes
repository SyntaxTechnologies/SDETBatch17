String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,d,C), numbers(10,25),
    special characters(#,$,%)) in the form of a group. There are many methods
    already written by java developers that we can just use. This is the most widely

    for example:
    length()
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
