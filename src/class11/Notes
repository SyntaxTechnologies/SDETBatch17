String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,d,C), numbers(10,25),
    special characters(#,$,%)) in the form of a group. There are many methods
    already written by java developers that we can just use. This is the most widely
    used class in java.
    for example:
    length()
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()
Why we should learn about this class.
    1) Very important for coding questions.
    2) Most widely used class in all java.
    3) Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.

Method Chaining:
    when multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining.
    String class supports methods changing. for method changing to work previous method must
    return the the expected datatype for the next method.
    Example
     String str="   Batch 17 IS GREAT.    ";
            System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","Good"));
          //  System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().isEmpty().replace("great","Good"));

Note:
 Very important for coding questions.
 1) If else
 2) Loops
 3) Arrays
 4) Strings
