Methods/Functions/Behaviours/routines
    methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
    when we call a methods.
There are two main types of methods:
    1) Methods which do not return any data(void type)
    2) Methods which can return data like int double char etc.
Syntax:
datatype methodName (dataType nameOfParameter,dataType nameofOtherParam){
this is where we write the logic

return the results if method type is not void

}

int add(int num1,int num2){
        int result=num1+num2;

        return result;
    }

int=> return type of method
add=>name of the method
(int num1,int num2) => parameters
    {              => Body of the method
        int result=num1+num2;

        return result;
    }












Note:
    WE will go over StringBuilder vs String
    We will go over some of the homeworks as well
